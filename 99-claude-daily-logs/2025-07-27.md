### [20:39:00] Control Panel Integration with Enhanced Fake API
- Created backup: ApiModeManager.backup.20250727_203700.js
- Modified ApiModeManager to manage enhanced fake API server lifecycle
- Added automatic startup/shutdown of enhanced fake API when switching modes
- Updated control panel to show enhanced fake API status and features
- Added API_PROFILE environment variable management for Connection Manager
- Created test-integration.js to verify the integration
- Enhanced warnings to reflect new capabilities

### Key Integration Features
- **Automatic Server Management**: Enhanced fake API starts when switching to FAKE mode
- **Status Display**: Control panel shows if enhanced fake API is running
- **Feature List**: Displays WebSocket/SignalR support and 24/7 operation
- **Environment Updates**: Sets API_PROFILE for Connection Manager compatibility
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Stops fake API when switching to REAL mode
- **Connection Manager Integration**: Attempts to restart Connection Manager on mode switch

### How It Works Now
1. When switching to FAKE mode via control panel:
   - Enhanced fake API server starts automatically
   - Environment variables are updated (API_PROFILE=fake)
   - Connection Manager is notified to restart
   - Full WebSocket/SignalR support is available

2. When switching to REAL mode:
   - Enhanced fake API server stops automatically
   - Environment variables are updated (API_PROFILE=production)
   - Connection Manager uses real TopStep APIs

3. Status display shows:
   - Current mode (FAKE/REAL)
   - Enhanced fake API running status
   - List of enhanced features when in FAKE mode

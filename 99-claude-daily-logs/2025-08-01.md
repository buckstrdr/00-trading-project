### [08:35:40] Agent 009 - Standardize Bot Configurations for Strategy Flexibility
- **Context**: User noted that all bots should be able to use any strategy
- **Analysis**: The configuration UI already supports dynamic strategy switching
- **Issue Found**: SWING_PULLBACK strategy was shown in UI but not implemented
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed SWING_PULLBACK option from the UI since it's not implemented

### [08:37:45] Agent 009 - Analyze EMA Strategy Implementation
- **Context**: User pointed out there is no EMA crossover strategy
- **Finding**: The "EMA_CROSS" strategy is actually "EMA 9 Retracement Scalping Strategy v3.0"
- **How it works**:
  - NOT a crossover strategy at all
  - Uses EMA 9 and EMA 19 for trend and retracement detection
  - Entry: When price retraces back through EMA 9 after going beyond it
  - Stop Loss: Dynamically placed at EMA 19
  - Real-time state machine tracking price movements
  - Two modes: STANDARD and CONSERVATIVE
- **Issue**: UI shows "EMA Cross" but this is misleading
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated strategy display name to "EMA 9 Retracement Scalping"
  - Fixed all parameter names to match actual implementation
  - Added retracement mode selector (STANDARD/CONSERVATIVE)
  - Added all missing parameters: confirmationCandles, maxBarsSinceEMA
  - Removed reverseOnEMATouch parameter as it's not implemented in the strategy
  - Added detailed strategy description explaining it's NOT a crossover strategy
  - Updated getStrategyParameters() to return correct parameter names

### [08:55:45] Agent 009 - Implement EMA Strategy Enhancement Parameters
- **Context**: User requested adding two new parameters to EMA strategy
- **Parameters Added**:
  1. **maxBarsSinceEMA**: Maximum bars price can consolidate between EMAs before invalidating setup (avoids choppy markets)
  2. **postTradeCandleTimeout**: Number of candles to wait after trade closes before looking for next signal
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added both parameters to config.html UI with proper descriptions
  - Updated EMASignalGenerator to track consolidation between EMAs
  - Added post-trade timeout tracking with candle counting
  - Created onPositionClosed() method to hook into position management
  - Updated generateSignal() to respect both new conditions
  - Added parameters to BOT_1.yaml and BOT_3.yaml configurations
- **Default Values**:
  - maxBarsSinceEMA: 15 candles (prevents trading in consolidation)
  - postWinCandleTimeout: 3 candles (short wait after profitable trades)
  - postLossCandleTimeout: 10 candles (longer wait after losses to avoid revenge trading)
- **Status**: Completed
- **Enhancement**: Split post-trade timeout into separate win/loss parameters
  - onPositionClosed() now accepts wasProfit parameter
  - Different wait times for wins vs losses
  - Helps avoid revenge trading after stop losses

  - EMA is for all-day trending markets
  - ORB is for opening volatility and first 2-3 hours
  - Both include comprehensive position sizing and filtering
- **Status**: Completed - User's request fully addressed

### [09:26:45] Agent 009 - Remove Automatic Market-on-Timeout Conversion
- **Context**: User wants bot to only place market orders when strategy explicitly decides to
- **Issue**: "Use Market on Timeout" was defaulting to true/enabled
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Updated config.html to only enable checkbox when explicitly set to true (not default)
  2. Updated all bot configuration files to set useMarketOnTimeout: false
     - BOT_1.yaml: Changed from true to false
     - BOT_2.yaml: Changed from true to false  
     - BOT_3.yaml: Changed from true to false
     - BOT_4.yaml: Changed from true to false
- **Result**: Bots will now maintain LIMIT orders until timeout, not auto-convert to MARKET
- **Strategy Impact**: 
  - Strategies can still explicitly choose MARKET orders when needed
  - Prevents unwanted slippage from auto-conversion
  - Gives strategies full control over order type decisions
- **Status**: Completed

### [10:01:55] Agent 009 - Update Risk Management UI for Strategy-Managed Exits
- **Context**: User requested to update risk management UI to properly handle strategy-managed stop losses and take profits
- **Key Changes Made**:
  1. **UI Updates (config.html)**:
     - Removed fixed stop loss and profit target fields from risk management section
     - Added info box explaining that SL/TP are strategy-managed
     - Added partial exits toggle that only works with >1 contract
     - Added clarification to breakeven trigger label
     - Both strategy sections now include proper exit management parameters

     - ORB Strategy (in UI): stopLossORPercent and stopLossBufferTicks
  3. **Configuration Updates (all bot YAMLs)**:
     - Added stopLossBuffer: 2 and riskRewardRatio: 3 to all EMA_CROSS strategies
     - BOT_1 through BOT_6 all updated with new parameters
- **Exit Logic Implementation**:
  - EMA: SL at slow EMA + buffer ticks, TP at configurable R:R (default 3)
  - ORB: SL as % of OR (100% = opposite side, 50% = midpoint), TP at 3x OR range
  - Rubber Band: SL at reversal/breakout candle high/low (whichever is furthest)

### [10:08:15] Agent 009 - Add Trailing Stop Feature to Risk Management
- **Context**: User requested to add a bot-managed trailing stop feature that updates both SL and TP once triggered
- **Requirements**:
  - Trailing stop managed by bot (not broker)
  - Activates at specified profit level (R-multiple)
  - Updates both stop loss and take profit as price moves favorably
  - Per-strategy enable/disable option
- **Changes Made**:
  1. **UI Updates (config.html)**:
     - Added Trailing Stop section in Risk Management after Partial Exits
     - Added Enable Trailing Stop toggle with visibility control
     - Added Activation Trigger field (R-multiple when to activate)
     - Added Trail Distance field (ticks to trail behind best price)
     - Added Adjust Take Profit toggle (to move TP with trailing stop)
     - Added toggleTrailingStop() function for UI control
  2. **Strategy Integration**:
     - Added "Enable Trailing Stop for this Strategy" checkbox in both EMA and ORB strategy sections
     - Added trailingStopEnabled parameter to strategy configurations
     - Updated save function to include trailing stop in exits configuration
     - Updated populateForm to load trailing stop settings
  3. **Configuration Updates (all bot YAMLs)**:
     - Added trailingStopEnabled: false to all strategy parameters
     - Added trailingStop section to exits with enabled, trigger, distance, and adjustTP fields
     - All 6 bots (BOT_1 through BOT_6) updated with consistent trailing stop configuration
- **Trailing Stop Logic**:
  - Bot monitors position profit in R-multiples
  - When profit reaches trigger level (e.g., 1R), trailing stop activates
  - Stop loss trails behind best price by specified tick distance
  - If adjustTP enabled, take profit moves up maintaining original R:R ratio
  - Only active if both global trailing stop and strategy-specific enable are true
- **Status**: Completed

### [10:34:15] Agent 009 - Fix JavaScript Error in Config UI
- **Context**: User reported error when loading config: "Cannot set properties of null (setting 'value')"
- **Issue**: The updateStrategyParams() function was using currentConfig before it was properly initialized
- **Root Cause**: 
  - populateForm() was calling updateStrategyParams() which generates dynamic HTML using currentConfig values
  - But currentConfig might be empty or null when first called
  - This caused null reference errors when trying to set values on non-existent elements
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Added safe property access (?.) to all currentConfig references in updateStrategyParams()
  2. Created populateStrategyParameters() function to populate strategy fields after they're created
  3. Added setTimeout to ensure DOM elements exist before trying to populate them
  4. Fixed all template references in both EMA_CROSS and ORB_RUBBER_BAND strategies
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated all ${currentConfig.strategy?.parameters} to ${currentConfig?.strategy?.parameters}
  - Split strategy parameter population into separate deferred function
  - Fixed checkbox references to use safe property access
  - Ensured all dynamic elements are created before attempting to populate values
- **Status**: Completed - Error should now be resolved

### [10:36:50] Agent 009 - Link Trailing Stop Switches
- **Context**: User noted that trailing stop switches in strategy and risk settings should be linked
- **Issue**: When enabling trailing stop in strategy, the main risk settings switch didn't update (and vice versa)
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - Enabling trailing stop in strategy should also enable it in risk settings
  - Enabling trailing stop in risk settings should also enable it in strategy
  - Both switches should stay in sync
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Added `onchange="syncTrailingStopSwitches()"` to strategy trailing stop checkboxes
  2. Updated `toggleTrailingStop()` to sync strategy checkbox when main checkbox changes
  3. Created `syncTrailingStopSwitches()` function to sync main checkbox when strategy checkbox changes
  4. Updated `populateStrategyParameters()` to ensure switches are synced when loading configuration
- **Technical Details**:
  - Main trailing stop checkbox ID: `trailingStopEnabled`
  - Strategy trailing stop checkbox ID: `strategyTrailingStopEnabled`
  - Both checkboxes now update each other when changed
  - When loading config, if strategy has trailing stop enabled, main switch is also enabled
- **Status**: Completed - Switches are now properly linked

### [10:47:20] Agent 009 - Fix Config Loading Error with Graceful Fallback
- **Context**: Config UI was showing "Cannot set properties of null" error when API endpoints weren't available
- **Issue**: The loadConfig() function was failing when `/api/config` endpoint returned 500 error
- **Root Cause**: Since the bot isn't integrated yet, the API endpoints don't exist
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Modified loadConfig() to gracefully handle API failures
  2. Created getDefaultConfig() function that returns a complete default configuration
  3. When API fails, the UI now loads with default values instead of crashing
  4. Added proper error handling with console warnings and user-friendly messages
- **Default Configuration Includes**:
  - Basic settings: BOT_1, port 3004, disabled by default
  - EMA_CROSS strategy with standard parameters
  - Risk management with $200 per trade, 3 max consecutive losses
  - Exit management with breakeven at 1.5R
  - Trading hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST
  - Market order execution with 2 tick slippage
  - Monitoring enabled with 5-minute intervals
- **User Experience**:
  - Shows "Using default configuration" message when API unavailable
  - Form loads properly with all default values
  - No more null reference errors
  - Config can still be saved (when API is available)
- **Status**: Completed - Config UI now loads successfully even without backend

### [11:13:00] Agent 009 - Remove Bot Enabled Toggle from Config UI
- **Context**: User correctly noted that bot enable/disable should be managed from the control panel, not config
- **Issue**: The "Bot Enabled" toggle was showing in the Basic Settings section of config UI
- **Rationale**: 
  - Bot start/stop control belongs in the main dashboard/control panel
  - Configuration should only contain bot parameters and settings
  - Enable/disable is a runtime control, not a configuration setting
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Removed the entire "Bot Enabled" form group from HTML
  2. Removed `document.getElementById('enabled').checked` from populateForm()
  3. Removed `enabled: document.getElementById('enabled').checked` from save function
  4. Removed `enabled: false` from default configuration object
- **Result**: 
  - Config UI now only shows configuration settings
  - Bot ID, Port, Description, and Instrument remain
  - Enable/disable will be controlled from the main control panel
- **Status**: Completed - UI is cleaner and more focused on configuration only

### [11:39:40] Agent 009 - Implement Config Backend API Integration
- **Context**: User requested backend functionality to save/load bot configurations from YAML files
- **Analysis**: Found existing bot-config-server.js with API endpoints already implemented
- **Backend Features**:
  - GET `/api/bot/config/:botId` - Loads bot config from YAML file
  - POST `/api/bot/config/:botId` - Saves bot config to YAML file
  - Uses js-yaml for YAML parsing/generation
  - Serves config UI on port 3010
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Updated config.html to use correct API endpoints:
     - Changed `/api/config` to `/api/bot/config/${botId}`
     - Both load and save functions now use bot-specific endpoints
  2. Updated bot-config-server.js:
     - Fixed HTML file path from 'bot-config-ui.html' to 'public/config.html'
     - Added static file serving for public directory
  3. Created test-config-server.js for easy testing
- **How to Use**:
  1. Run: `node src/core/trading/test-config-server.js`
  2. Open: http://localhost:3010
  3. Config will load from `config/bots/BOT_X.yaml`
  4. Changes save back to the same YAML file
- **Result**: 
  - Config UI now fully integrated with backend
  - YAML files are read and written correctly
  - Bot configurations persist between sessions
- **Status**: Completed - Config backend is ready to use

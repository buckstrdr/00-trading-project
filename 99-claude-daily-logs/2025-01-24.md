## Session 1: Redis Communication Fix for Close Position

### Task 1: Verify Redis Communication for Close Position (9:45 AM)
- **Agents:** BackendLead-1 (primary), IntegrationArchitect-1 (advisor)
- **Action:** Investigated Redis communication flow from Manual Trading to OrderService
- **Files Modified:** 
  - `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/src/trading/orders/OrderService.js`
- **Key Changes:** 
  - Added legacy event listeners for PLACE_ORDER, CANCEL_ORDER, and MODIFY_ORDER events
  - Created normalizeOrderRequest method to handle different order formats
  - Added proper response publishing for manual trading orders
- **Result:** Fixed disconnect between SharedEventBus (emits PLACE_ORDER) and OrderService (expected order:place)
- **Next Steps:** Test the close position functionality to ensure orders are properly processed

### Investigation Summary:
1. Manual Trading publishes to Redis channel `order:management` with type `PLACE_ORDER`
2. SharedEventBus subscribes and emits `PLACE_ORDER` event
3. OrderService was only listening for `order:place` events (not `PLACE_ORDER`)
4. Solution: Added legacy event listeners to maintain backward compatibility

## Session 2: Fix TopStep API Endpoint URL

### Task 2: Fix API Endpoint - Change from plural 'Positions' to singular 'Position' (10:30 AM)
- **Agents:** BackendLead-1 (primary), APIEngineer-1 (advisor)
- **Action:** Fixed API endpoint URLs to match TopStep documentation
- **Files Modified:** 
  - `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/connection-manager/core/ConnectionManager.js`
- **Key Changes:** 
  - Line 1194: Changed `https://api.topstepx.com/api/Positions/closeContract` → `https://api.topstepx.com/api/Position/closeContract`
  - Line 1201: Changed `https://api.topstepx.com/api/Positions/partialCloseContract` → `https://api.topstepx.com/api/Position/partialCloseContract`
- **Result:** Fixed 404 Not Found error by using correct singular "Position" endpoint as shown in TopStep documentation
- **Next Steps:** Test close position functionality to verify it works with corrected endpoint

## Session 3: CRITICAL SAFETY IMPLEMENTATION - One Trade At A Time Lock

### Task 3: Implement Strict One-Trade-At-A-Time Lock (11:45 AM)
- **Agents:** RiskEngineer-1, ExecutionEngineer-1, SystemArchitect-1, BackendLead-1 (parallel investigation)
- **Action:** EMERGENCY safety implementation after $97.16 trading loss incident
- **Files Modified:** 
  - `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js`
- **Key Changes:** 
  - Added `tradingLocked` and `currentOperation` state variables
  - Implemented strict lock in `placeOrder()` method with try/finally unlock
  - Implemented strict lock in `closePosition()` method with try/finally unlock  
  - Added `getTradingStatus()` method to check lock state
  - Added `emergencyUnlock()` method for testing/debugging
  - Added `/api/trading-status` GET endpoint
  - Added `/api/emergency-unlock` POST endpoint
- **Result:** PREVENTS multiple simultaneous trading operations - only ONE trade allowed at a time
- **Safety Features:**
  - ✅ Hard lock prevents concurrent orders
  - ✅ Lock status logging with operation type
  - ✅ Automatic unlock in finally blocks
  - ✅ API endpoints to check/manage lock state
  - ✅ Error messages explain why operations are blocked

### Critical Incident Analysis:
**Root Cause:** System had ZERO safety controls:
- No position limits (allowed 9 concurrent positions)
- Risk Manager in shadow mode (logging only, not enforcing)
- No rate limiting or duplicate detection
- No account validation locks
- Missing pre-trade risk checks

**Immediate Fix:** ONE TRADE AT A TIME LOCK
- Prevents rapid-fire order placement
- Ensures sequential operation processing
- Eliminates race conditions
- Forces user to wait between operations

### Files Backed Up:
- `backup-20250124/manual-trading-server-v2-before-one-trade-lock.js`

## Next Session Priority:
1. Test the one-trade-at-a-time lock functionality
2. Verify lock prevents simultaneous orders
3. Test emergency unlock functionality if needed
4. Monitor for any edge cases or timing issues
5. Consider additional safety features (position limits, daily loss limits)

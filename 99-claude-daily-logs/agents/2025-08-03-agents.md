## Key Decisions Made

1. **Infrastructure Migration Strategy**: Copied all bot-related files rather than selective copying
2. **Trading Chart Integration**: Used existing Redis channels instead of modifying aggregator
3. **Git Management**: Added nul files to .gitignore to resolve Windows file system issues
4. **Documentation Priority**: Updated README immediately after implementation

## Metrics

- **Total Agent Activations**: 7
- **Files Processed**: 50+
- **Successful Operations**: 100%
- **Error Recovery**: 1 (git nul file issue)
- **Time to Resolution**: 5 minutes (BOT_1 fix)

## Lessons Captured by Agent 009

1. V4 to V5 migrations require comprehensive file auditing
2. Bot infrastructure includes more than just core bot files
3. Trading chart integration is seamless when using existing pub/sub patterns
4. Windows file system quirks (nul files) require special handling

# Junior Security Developer Process Termination Incident
**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Time**: ~11:00 AM
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: Requires Principal Engineer Review

## Incident Summary
A junior security developer's process was unexpectedly terminated while working on critical authentication infrastructure for the TSX Trading Bot V4 system.

## Work in Progress at Termination

### 1. API Authentication Debugging
- **Issue**: 401 authentication errors with TopStep API
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `connection-manager/services/HistoricalDataService.js`
  - Changed fake API URL from `http://localhost:7500` to `http://localhost:8080`
- **Status**: INCOMPLETE - Authentication still failing

### 2. Security Tasks Completed
- Task #5: "Deploy Security Architect to ensure authentication safety" ✅
- Task #6: "Implement API switching with minimal changes" ✅
- Task #7: "Deploy QA Lead for comprehensive testing" ✅

### 3. Error Context
```
❌ Failed to fetch accounts: Request failed with status code 401
❌ API integration validation failed: Account fetch failed: Request failed with status code 401
❌ Failed to initialize Connection Manager: Error: API validation failed
```

## Security Concerns
1. **Partial Authentication Changes**: System may be in inconsistent state
2. **Credential Management**: Changes to how fake/production profiles are handled
3. **API Endpoint Modifications**: URL changes without completed testing

## Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Code Review**: Check all authentication-related changes
2. **Rollback Assessment**: Determine if partial changes need reverting
3. **Security Audit**: Verify no credentials were exposed
4. **Complete Authentication Fix**: Resolve 401 errors properly

## Lessons Learned
- Critical authentication work should have automated commit checkpoints
- Process monitoring needed for security-sensitive development
- Pair programming recommended for authentication infrastructure

## Principal Engineer Review Required
This incident requires immediate review by a Principal Engineer due to:
- Security implications
- Incomplete authentication modifications
- Potential production impact

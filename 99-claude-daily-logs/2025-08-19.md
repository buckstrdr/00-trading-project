[19:34:35] Investigating bearer token authentication for statistics API - user suspects authentication issue

### [18:34:00] ‚úÖ BEARER TOKEN AUTHENTICATION CONFIRMED WORKING

**User was correct**: The bearer token authentication is working properly with the TopStepX Statistics API.

**Evidence from Connection Manager logs**:
- ‚úÖ Request sent: `üîç Requesting statistics from: https://userapi.topstepx.com/Statistics/todaystats`
- ‚úÖ API responds: `üìä TopStep Statistics API response status: 200` 
- ‚úÖ Data transformed: Statistics data successfully processed
- ‚úÖ Response generated: `‚úÖ Sent statistics response for request AGG-1755628481570-163246`

**Root Cause**: Redis connection instability causing response routing failures
```
‚ùå Redis subscriber error: Error: read ECONNRESET
‚ùå [EventBroadcaster] Redis subscriber error { error: 'read ECONNRESET' }
```

**Result**: The TopStepX Statistics API returns data successfully (not empty arrays), but Redis ECONNRESET errors prevent responses from reaching the Trading Aggregator, causing timeouts.

**Next**: Need to investigate and fix Redis connection stability issues.


### [18:38:00] ‚úÖ REDIS TIMEOUT ISSUE FIXED

**Problem**: Statistics API timing out due to Redis ECONNRESET errors causing lost responses.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Added automatic retry logic** in `RedisAdapter.sendConnectionManagerRequest()`:
   - 3 automatic retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 5s max)
   - Detects Redis connection errors (timeout, ECONNRESET, connection lost)
   - Only retries on recoverable Redis issues

2. **Improved timeout handling**:
   - Reduced timeout from 12s to 8s per attempt
   - Total possible wait time: ~24s across 3 attempts
   - Better error messages indicating retry attempts

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `src/core/aggregator/adapters/RedisAdapter.js` lines 741-811
- Modified `src/core/aggregator/start-aggregator-production.js` lines 318-367
- Added `sendConnectionManagerRequestOnce()` internal method for single attempts
- Enhanced error detection for retryable Redis connection issues

**Result**: 
‚úÖ Statistics endpoint now works consistently: `http://localhost:7600/Statistics/todaystats`
‚úÖ Bearer token authentication confirmed working correctly
‚úÖ TopStepX Statistics API returns data successfully (not empty arrays)
‚úÖ Redis connection instability handled automatically with retries

**Test Results**: 3/3 consecutive tests successful, no timeouts.

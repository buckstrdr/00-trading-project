**Final Recommendation:** 
TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4 directory contains ALL critical operational files and is SUPERIOR to the original repository. V4 should be considered the production-ready version with enhanced risk management, better process control, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Session 13: V4 Migration Gap Analysis (Current Time)

### Task 22: Comprehensive V4 Migration Comparison (Current)
- **Agents:** system-architect (Primary) - Respecting sub-agent limits
- **Action:** Complete comparison between old and new V4 locations
- **Mission:** Identify all missing files and create migration plan
- **Repositories Compared:**
  - OLD: `C:\Users\salte\ClaudeProjects\github-repos\TSX_Trading_Bot\TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4`
  - NEW: `C:\Users\salte\ClaudeProjects\github-repos\TSX-Trading-Bot-V4`

### Key Findings:

**✅ Successfully Migrated (75% Complete):**
1. Core Infrastructure - All services and aggregator
2. Trading Aggregator - Complete system with monitoring
3. Shared Modules - Auth, resilience, data integrity
4. Connection Manager - Full module
5. UI Components - Control panel, config UI, manual trading
6. Scripts - All service management files
7. Tests - Complete test suites
8. Configuration - All YAML files
9. Dependencies - Package.json with all npm packages

**❌ Missing Critical Components (25% Remaining):**

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows** (.github/workflows/)
   - CI/CD pipelines missing
   - Impact: No automated testing/deployment

2. **API Layer** (src/api/)
   - Middleware and routes missing
   - Impact: API endpoints non-functional

3. **Core Business Models** (src/core/)
   - accounts/, events/, market-data/, positions/, trading/
   - Impact: Core business logic incomplete

4. **Trading Strategies** (src/strategies/)
   - EMA and ORB strategies missing
   - Impact: No trading algorithms available

5. **Documentation**
   - Architecture docs missing
   - Impact: No system documentation

6. **TypeScript Files**
   - Various .ts interfaces and types
   - Impact: TypeScript compilation may fail

### Sub-Agent Deployment Plan:

**Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (3 agents)**
```bash
@sub-agent system-architect,backend-lead,api-engineer
```
- Migrate core models, API layer, TypeScript files

**Phase 2: Trading Components (3 agents)**
```bash
@sub-agent trading-lead,quant-developer,data-architect
```
- Migrate strategies, trading interfaces, data models

**Phase 3: DevOps & Documentation (3 agents)**
```bash
@sub-agent devops-lead,security-engineer,scribe
```
- GitHub workflows, environment setup, documentation

**Phase 4: Testing & Validation (3 agents)**
```bash
@sub-agent qa-lead,test-engineer,performance-engineer
```
- Comprehensive testing and validation

### Files Created:
- `docs/V4_MIGRATION_COMPARISON_REPORT.md` - Full comparison report with detailed analysis

### Risk Assessment:
- **HIGH**: Missing core business models and API layer
- **MEDIUM**: Missing trading strategies
- **LOW**: Missing documentation

### Estimated Completion Time: 4-6 hours with parallel execution

## Session End: Current Time

---

## Next Session Priority:
1. **PHASE 1 MIGRATION:** Deploy system-architect, backend-lead, api-engineer for core models
2. **PHASE 2 MIGRATION:** Deploy trading team for strategies migration
3. **PHASE 3 MIGRATION:** Deploy DevOps team for CI/CD and documentation
4. **PHASE 4 VALIDATION:** Deploy QA team for comprehensive testing
5. **PRODUCTION READINESS:** Final validation for live trading deployment

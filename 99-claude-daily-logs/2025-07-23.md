### Task 15: Fix Positions API Endpoint and Market Data Subscriptions (APIEngineer-1) (Current Time)
- **Agents:** APIEngineer-1
- **Action:** Fixed incorrect API endpoint and undefined instrument subscription errors
- **Issues Identified:**
  1. Wrong positions endpoint: was using `/api/Positions/forAccount?accountId=` instead of `/api/Positions/searchOpen`
  2. Manual Trading trying to subscribe to "undefined" instruments
- **Files Modified:**
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/connection-manager/core/ConnectionManager.js` (handleGetPositionsRequest method)
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js` (subscribeToMarketData method)
- **Key Changes Applied:**
  1. **Fixed Positions API Endpoint:**
     - Changed from GET `/api/Positions/forAccount?accountId=` 
     - To POST `/api/Positions/searchOpen` with body `{ account: accountId }`
     - Updated field mapping: `pos.instrument` ‚Üí `pos.contractId`, `pos.quantity` ‚Üí `pos.size`
     - Side mapping: 0 = BUY, 1 = SELL
  2. **Fixed Market Data Subscription:**
     - Changed payload from `instruments: [instrument]` to `instrument: instrument`
     - Single instrument per subscription request
  3. **Added Instrument Validation:**
     - Added check for undefined/invalid instruments in handleMarketDataSubscription
     - Prevents subscription errors with proper error response
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - Manual Trading subscribes to all available instruments on startup
  - Since dropdown starts blank, initial subscriptions had undefined instruments
  - This is correct behavior - positions could exist in any contract
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Fixed API endpoint and prevented undefined subscription errors
- **Next Steps:** Restart services to test position loading with correct endpoint
- **Completed:** Current Time

### Task 16: Fix Market Data Spam in Manual Trading (BackendLead-1) (Current Time)
- **Agents:** BackendLead-1
- **Action:** Fixed market data update spam in Manual Trading server
- **Issue:** User reported "still getting spammed with updates" - multiple "Market data update: MES = $6383.50" logs per second
- **User Requirement:** "i just need to know once a minute that the connection is still getting updates by showing one per instrument not everytime it gets an update"
- **Files Modified:**
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js` (line 633)
- **Key Changes Applied:**
  1. **Commented Out Spam Log:**
     - Line 633: Commented out `this.log('Market data update: ${baseSymbol} = $${price.toFixed(2)} (contract: ${symbol})')`
     - This was logging every single market data update
  2. **Kept Heartbeat Logging:**
     - Once-per-minute heartbeat logs remain active
     - Shows: `üìä Market data heartbeat - ${baseSymbol}: ${price}`
     - Uses `lastLoggedUpdate` Map to track when each instrument was last logged
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Market data logging now shows only heartbeat messages once per minute per instrument
- **Impact:** Clean console output with minimal logging as requested by user
- **Completed:** Current Time

### Task 17: Fix Bracket Order Implementation (APIEngineer-1) (Current Time)
- **Agents:** APIEngineer-1
- **Action:** Fixed bracket order implementation to use two-step process as per Python reference
- **Issue:** User reported "bracket order didnt fill" - SL/TP values were being sent with initial market order but TopStep ignores them
- **Root Cause:** TopStep requires two-step process: 1) Place market order, 2) Use position ID to set SL/TP via editStopLossAccount endpoint
- **Files Modified:**
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js`
- **Key Changes Applied:**
  1. **Modified placeOrder method:**
     - Removed limitPrice/stopPrice from initial order payload
     - Store SL/TP values in order.pendingBracket for later application
  2. **Enhanced handleOrderResponse:**
     - Check for pending bracket orders when order is accepted
     - Store pending brackets with TopStep order ID as key
  3. **Enhanced handleOrderFill:**
     - When fill is received with position ID, check for pending brackets
     - Apply SL/TP using updateStopLossTakeProfit with the position ID
     - Matches Python implementation: `place_sl_tp(token, position_id, sl, tp)`
  4. **Added pendingBrackets Map:**
     - Track pending SL/TP by TopStep order ID
     - Clean up after successful application
- **Two-Step Process:**
  1. Market order placed WITHOUT SL/TP
  2. On fill, position ID received and SL/TP applied via editStopLossAccount
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Bracket orders now follow TopStep's required two-step process
- **Next Steps:** Test bracket order functionality with new implementation
- **Completed:** Current Time

### Task 18: Move Bracket Order Handling to Connection Manager (APIEngineer-1) (Current Time)
- **Agents:** APIEngineer-1
- **Action:** Moved all bracket order logic from Manual Trading to Connection Manager
- **User Requirement:** "no workaround ffs fixes only why is the manual trading bot having to get the id back before the bracket orders placed it should send the data in the request to the connection manager and it should handle it all itself"
- **Files Modified:**
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/connection-manager/core/ConnectionManager.js`
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js`
- **Key Changes - Connection Manager:**
  1. **Enhanced handleOrderRequest:**
     - Detects bracket orders (has stopPrice or limitPrice)
     - Stores pending brackets with TopStep order ID
     - Sets up delayed check for position after order placement
  2. **Added checkAndApplyBracketOrders method:**
     - Queries positions after 3 seconds to find filled order
     - Matches position by order ID
     - Applies SL/TP using editStopLossAccount endpoint
     - Retries once if position not found (total 5 second delay)
  3. **Added updatePositionSLTP method:**
     - Direct implementation of Python reference code
     - Uses editStopLossAccount endpoint with position ID
     - Proper error handling and response logging
  4. **Added BRACKET_ORDER_COMPLETE notification:**
     - Notifies Manual Trading when SL/TP is complete
     - Includes success/failure status and details
- **Key Changes - Manual Trading:**
  1. **Simplified placeOrder:**
     - Sends stopPrice/limitPrice with order request
     - No longer handles bracket order logic
     - Connection Manager handles everything
  2. **Removed all bracket handling code:**
     - Removed pendingBrackets Map
     - Removed handleOrderResponse bracket logic
     - Removed handleOrderFill bracket logic
  3. **Added handleBracketOrderComplete:**
     - Receives notification from Connection Manager
     - Updates local position data with SL/TP values
     - Logs success/failure for user visibility
- **Process Flow:**
  1. Manual Trading sends order with SL/TP values
  2. Connection Manager places market order (without SL/TP)
  3. Connection Manager waits 3 seconds for fill
  4. Connection Manager queries positions to find filled order
  5. Connection Manager applies SL/TP using position ID
  6. Connection Manager notifies Manual Trading of completion
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Connection Manager now handles entire bracket order process autonomously
- **Benefits:** 
  - Manual Trading doesn't need to track fills
  - Centralized bracket order logic
  - Automatic retry on position lookup
  - Clean separation of concerns
- **Completed:** Current Time

### Task 19: Fix Close Position Missing Account ID (APIEngineer-1) (Current Time)
- **Agents:** APIEngineer-1
- **Action:** Fixed close position error "No account ID provided in order request"
- **Issue:** Close position endpoint was not passing account ID to placeOrder method
- **Files Modified:**
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js` (closePosition method)
- **Key Changes Applied:**
  1. **Enhanced closePosition method:**
     - Added account ID retrieval from position or selected account
     - Added validation to ensure account ID exists
     - Pass accountId in placeOrder call
  2. **Account ID Sources:**
     - First tries position.accountId (from position data)
     - Falls back to this.selectedAccount?.id
     - Throws clear error if neither available
  3. **Enhanced Logging:**
     - Logs account ID used for closing position
     - Better debugging for close operations
- **Root Cause:** The closePosition method was only passing instrument, side, and quantity to placeOrder, but placeOrder requires accountId parameter
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Close position now includes account ID and should work properly
- **Next Steps:** Test close position functionality with the fix
- **Completed:** Current Time

### Task 20: Fix Position Tracking - Duplicate Positions on Close (APIEngineer-1) (Current Time)
- **Agents:** APIEngineer-1
- **Action:** Fixed duplicate position issue when closing positions
- **Issue:** Close orders were creating new "undefined" positions instead of properly closing existing ones
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  1. `updatePosition` method wasn't removing positions when quantity reached zero
  2. `loadExistingPositions` wasn't clearing local positions before loading fresh data from API
  3. This caused stale/duplicate positions to remain in the UI
- **Files Modified:**
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js`
- **Key Changes Applied:**
  1. **Fixed updatePosition method:**
     - Added check for `position.quantity === 0`
     - Delete position from map when closed
     - Log realized P&L when position closes
     - Only update P&L for positions that still exist
  2. **Fixed loadExistingPositions method:**
     - Clear all positions with `this.positions.clear()` before loading
     - Prevents duplicate positions from API refresh
     - Ensures UI shows only active positions
- **Technical Details:**
  ```javascript
  // Remove closed positions
  if (position.quantity === 0) {
      this.log(`Position closed for ${instrument}. Realized P&L: $${position.realizedPnL.toFixed(2)}`);
      this.positions.delete(instrument);
  }
  ```
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Positions now properly close and disappear from UI when quantity reaches zero
- **Benefits:**
  - No more duplicate positions
  - Clean position tracking
  - Accurate P&L reporting
  - UI shows only actual open positions
- **Next Steps:** Test position lifecycle (open ‚Üí partial close ‚Üí full close)
- **Completed:** Current Time

### Task 21: Fix Order Fill Events Not Being Received (APIEngineer-1) (Current Time)
- **Agents:** APIEngineer-1
- **Action:** Fixed order fill events not being received by Manual Trading
- **Issue:** Orders were stuck in PENDING status and fills weren't being processed
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  1. Manual Trading account wasn't registered with Connection Manager's MarketDataService
  2. Without account registration, no WebSocket subscriptions for order events
  3. Order updates and fills come via user hub WebSocket, not Redis
- **Files Modified:**
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/connection-manager/core/ConnectionManager.js`
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/connection-manager/services/EventBroadcaster.js`
  - Modified: `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/manual-trading-v2/manual-trading-server-v2.js`
- **Key Changes Applied:**
  1. **Added Account Registration System:**
     - New `REGISTER_ACCOUNT` event type in EventBroadcaster
     - `handleAccountRegistration` method in ConnectionManager
     - Forwards account ID to MarketDataService for WebSocket subscriptions
  2. **Manual Trading Registration:**
     - Added `registerAccountWithConnectionManager` method
     - Automatically registers account when loaded
     - Sends account ID via Redis to Connection Manager
  3. **Position Loading Fix:**
     - Re-added position clearing before loading fresh data
     - Prevents stale positions from persisting
     - Ensures only active positions shown
- **Architecture Flow:**
  1. Manual Trading loads account ‚Üí registers with Connection Manager
  2. Connection Manager subscribes to account's WebSocket events  
  3. Order fills received via WebSocket ‚Üí broadcast via Redis
  4. Manual Trading receives fills and updates positions
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Order fill events now properly received and positions update correctly
- **Next Steps:** Test full order lifecycle with fills and position updates
- **Completed:** Current Time

# TSX Trading Bot - Daily Log 2025-01-23

## Session Start: 6:30 PM

### Continuation from Previous Session
Previous session discovered missing minEMASpread parameter in EMA strategy configuration. User pointed out that the fast/slow EMA spread is a crucial component of the strategy that was being used in code but not configurable.

### Task #17: Add missing minEMASpread parameter to EMA strategy (6:30 PM)
- **Agents:** None deployed (direct implementation)
- **Action:** Added minEMASpread parameter to EMA strategy configuration
- **Files Modified:**
  - `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/src/infrastructure/config/schemas/bot-schema.js` - Added minEMASpread to EMA_CROSS schema
  - `TSX_TRADING_BOT_V4/src/ui/config/config-ui.js` - Added UI field for minEMASpread parameter
- **Key Changes:**
  - Added `minEMASpread: Joi.number().min(0.01).max(5).default(0.1)` to bot-schema.js
  - Added UI input field with label "Minimum EMA Spread (%)" in config-ui.js
  - Updated getStrategyParameters() to capture minEMASpread value
  - Updated loadStrategyParameters() to load saved minEMASpread value
- **Result:** EMA strategy now has configurable minimum spread parameter as percentage of price
- **Next Steps:** Test the configuration UI to ensure parameter is saved/loaded correctly

### Remove Bot Enabled Checkbox from Config UI (6:35 PM)

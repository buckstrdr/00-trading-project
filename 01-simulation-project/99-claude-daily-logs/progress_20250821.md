## JavaScript Strategy Integration Recovery

### Problem Statement
- Major refactoring project crashed/failed
- Goal: Enable Python backtester to use JavaScript strategy files from TSX Bot V5
- Constraint: JS strategies must remain unchanged
- Requirement: Preserve all Python ML/PyBroker functionality

### Work Completed

#### 1. Analysis Phase
- Reviewed git history and previous attempts
- Found complex mainBot proxy implementation (overly ambitious)
- Identified core issue: Trying to replicate entire TSX Bot V5 instead of simple bridge

#### 2. Simplified Architecture Created
Successfully built minimal JS-Python bridge:

**Files Created:**
- `shared/strategy_runner.js` (128 lines) - Node.js runner with minimal mainBot mock
- `shared/js_strategy_adapter_simple.py` (146 lines) - Python adapter for subprocess communication
- `shared/js_strategy_adapter.py` - Full-featured version with strategy interface
- `strategies/test_js_strategy.js` - Test strategy using moving average crossover

#### 3. Verification Results

**What Works:**
✅ All files created and syntactically valid
✅ Node.js runner starts and responds to messages
✅ Test strategy can generate signals (verified independently)
✅ Basic communication established (READY signal received)

**Issues Found:**
❌ Python adapter has subprocess deadlock on readline()
❌ Integration test times out after 2 minutes
❌ End-to-end flow not fully functional

### Technical Details

The simplified approach:
1. Python sends price data as JSON message
2. JS strategy analyzes and returns signal
3. Python executes trades based on signal

Communication protocol:
```json
→ {"type": "PRICE_UPDATE", "data": {...}}
← {"type": "SIGNAL", "signal": "BUY/SELL/HOLD", ...}
```

### Next Steps Required

1. **Fix subprocess communication deadlock**
   - Issue: `readline()` blocking indefinitely
   - Solution: Implement non-blocking I/O or async subprocess

2. **Complete integration with BacktestService**
   - Update `/api/backtest/js` endpoint
   - Test with real TSX strategy files

3. **Add error handling**
   - Malformed strategy detection
   - Subprocess crash recovery
   - Timeout handling

### Files Modified
- `services/backtest_service.py` - Added JS endpoint (uncommitted)

### Cleanup Done
- Removed complex files: `commonjs_strategy_loader.js`, `js_strategy_adapter_v2.py`
- Removed test files: `test_commonjs_loader.js`, `test_mainbot_proxy.js`

### Time Invested
~1.5 hours on recovery and simplification

### Status
Partial success - architecture simplified but needs communication fix for production use.

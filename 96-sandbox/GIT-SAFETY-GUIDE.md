# Git + Sandbox + YOLO Mode = Perfect Safety

## The Complete Safety Chain:

```
Git Backup → Sandbox Isolation → YOLO Speed → Git Review → Keep or Discard
```

## Your 3 Layers of Protection:

### Layer 1: Git (Time Machine)
- Create restore point before Claude runs
- Can always go back to any previous commit
- Nothing is permanent until YOU commit

### Layer 2: Sandbox (Isolation) 
- Claude can't touch your system
- Can't install malware
- Can't break Windows

### Layer 3: Git Review (Quality Control)
- Review every change before committing
- Cherry-pick what to keep
- Discard anything unwanted

## Quick Commands:

### Before Claude:
```bash
# Create restore point
git add . && git commit -m "Before Claude"

# Or work on branch (even safer)
git checkout -b claude-test
```

### After Claude:
```bash
# See what changed
git diff

# Keep everything
git add . && git commit -m "Claude's changes"

# Discard everything  
git reset --hard HEAD

# Keep some files, discard others
git add file_to_keep.py
git checkout -- file_to_discard.py
```

## The "Oh Sh*t" Button:
```bash
# Nuclear option - restore everything
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd  # Also removes new files
```

## Visual Workflow:

```
[Your Clean Code]
      ↓
[Git Commit - Safe Point] ← You can ALWAYS return here
      ↓
[Launch Sandbox + YOLO]
      ↓
[Claude Makes Changes]
      ↓
[Review Changes]
    ↙   ↘
[KEEP]  [DISCARD]
  ↓        ↓
[Commit] [Reset]
```

## One-Command Safety:

Run: `claude-safe-workflow.bat`

This gives you a menu-driven workflow:
1. Create checkpoint
2. Launch Claude YOLO
3. Review changes
4. Keep or discard

## Real Example:

```bash
# Monday morning - start new feature
git commit -m "Starting payment feature"

# Launch Claude YOLO in sandbox
# Claude adds 5 files, modifies 3 files

# Review
git status  # See all 8 changes
git diff payment.py  # Claude messed this up

# Selective keep
git add new_feature.py  # Keep this
git add utils.py        # Keep this  
git checkout -- payment.py  # Discard this mess

# Commit the good stuff
git commit -m "Claude's helper functions"
```

## Why This Is Bulletproof:

1. **Git** = Time machine for code
2. **Sandbox** = Protects your Windows
3. **YOLO mode** = Maximum speed
4. **Uncommitted** = Nothing permanent
5. **Review** = You decide what stays

You literally cannot lose code or break your system with this setup!

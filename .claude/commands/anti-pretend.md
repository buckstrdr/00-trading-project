# Anti-Pretending Protocol Check

## CRITICAL: Prove you are NOT simulating outputs

This command FORCES real execution proof. If you cannot execute these, you are violating the protocol!

### Immediate Verification Required

Execute EACH command below and show the ACTUAL output:

```bash
# 1. Unique timestamp proof (impossible to predict)
echo "Timestamp with nanoseconds: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N')"
echo "Unix timestamp: $(date +%s%N)"

# 2. Random values (change every execution)
echo "Random 1: $RANDOM"
echo "Random 2: $RANDOM"
echo "Random 3: $RANDOM"
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64

# 3. System state (real-time data)
echo "Current processes: $(ps aux | wc -l)"
echo "Memory free: $(free -m | grep Mem | awk '{print $4}') MB"
echo "Load average: $(uptime | awk -F'load average:' '{print $2}')"

# 4. File system proof
echo "Creating verification file..."
VERIFY_FILE=".verify_$(date +%s%N).tmp"
echo "Verification at $(date)" > "$VERIFY_FILE"
echo "Random content: $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM" >> "$VERIFY_FILE"
cat "$VERIFY_FILE"
md5sum "$VERIFY_FILE"
rm "$VERIFY_FILE"
echo "File deleted"

# 5. Network state
echo "Active connections:"
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | head -5

# 6. Command execution proof
echo "Running actual command..."
ls -la | head -3
echo "Exit code: $?"

# 7. Error handling proof (deliberate failure)
echo "Testing error handling..."
ls /nonexistent/path/that/cannot/exist 2>&1
echo "Error code was: $?"

# 8. Command history (proves real session)
echo "Last 15 commands executed:"
history | tail -15

# 9. System resources (disk and memory state)
echo "Disk usage:"
df -h | head -5
echo "Memory state:"
free -m

# 10. Session environment (proves real terminal)
echo "Session ID: $$"
echo "Terminal: $(tty)"
echo "Environment proof: $USER @ $HOSTNAME"
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
```

### Verification Checklist

After running above commands, confirm:
- [ ] Timestamps show current time with nanoseconds
- [ ] Random numbers are different each time
- [ ] File was actually created and deleted
- [ ] Error message from failed command was shown
- [ ] Exit codes were displayed
- [ ] Command history shows real session activity
- [ ] Disk and memory usage displayed
- [ ] Session environment variables shown
- [ ] All 10 verification categories completed

### FORBIDDEN Responses

You MUST NOT respond with:
- "I've executed the commands" (without output)
- "The verification is complete" (without proof)
- Simulated outputs like "Timestamp: 2024-01-01 12:00:00"
- Generic success messages

### Required Statement

After showing ALL real outputs above, state:
"✓ Anti-pretending verification complete at [actual timestamp]"
"✓ All outputs are from real execution, not simulation"
"✓ Following CLAUDE.md verification protocol"
